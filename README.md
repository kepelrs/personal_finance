## Inspired by

This website is inspired by the [Google Front-End Web Dev Challenge Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships), a few of the [Mr. Money Mustache articles](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), and my will for [freedom](/static/freedom.jpg).

## First Project

This project is not yet Front-end only focused. For my first project it was my wish to make everything from scratch on the back-end as well, in order to get a feel for how all the moving parts of a webpage come together.

## Front end & Back end

For the Front-end I avoided libraries, as I wanted to practice the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery concepts from the course.

For the Back-end I used Python's Flask library, the Peewee library, and for the Login I tried to implement a very rudimentary login scheme of my own.

## Hosting

I am currently hosting this project at home on a RaspberryPi.

## Closing notes

I maybe be soon uploading a short guide meant for fellow web development newbies like me, who want to know how to host their own starter pages easily.

As of right now I don't intend to improve this project.
It was meant as a first project, and I want to keep it as it is.

Looking back at all the code, I can say that I "gently hate it". I can now see many ways how it could be so much better, but I didn't know how when I first started. In this way I'm happy with all that I've learned, and I'm sure that my next project will have a much better starting point because of this experience.
